# Augmented Reality Game

This project is a simple example of an Augmented Reality (AR) game developed in Java using the JavaFX library for graphics.

## Description

The "Augmented Reality Game" project demonstrates how to create a basic AR game where virtual objects are overlaid onto a real-world background. In this example, the background image represents the real-world environment, and a game object image is placed on top to simulate interaction with the environment.

## Features

- Displays a real-world background image.
- Positions a virtual game object image on top of the background.
- Provides a basic setup for building more complex AR games.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    
    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/your_username/augmented-reality-game.git>
    
    ```
    
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Run the `AugmentedRealityGame.java` file.

## Usage

- Upon running the application, you will see the real-world background image with a virtual game object overlaid on top.
- You can customize the background and game object images by replacing the provided image files (`background.jpg` and `gameObject.png`) with your own images.

## Dependencies

- JavaFX library
